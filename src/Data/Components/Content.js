                        Between the running, lunging, diving and ball hitting, playing badminton burns fat at 
                        approximately 450 calories per hour. This kind of cardiovascular workout can help keep you in tip top shape, 
                        especially if youâ€™re looking for a good alternative cross-training exercise.
